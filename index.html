    <p>I'm Musa Jallow, a highschool student interested in coding, videogames, and basketball. I live in the Bronx and I attend the Trinity School in Manhattan. I've coded in HTML, CSS, JS with the p5.js library, Java with the Processing library, Arduino with TinkerCad Circuits, and a bit of Python.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Projects">
    <p>Here are some projects I've coded either alone, as part of a group, or with some help. Links are at the bottom. There are also other projects that are on my Github account, which will also be linked further down this page.</p>
    <img id = "Arduino" src = "images/Memory Game .png" alt = "A picture of my memory game made in TinkerCad Circuits in Arduino is supposed to be here,"/>
    <p>Here is an image of the Memory Game I made using a virtual Arduino in TinkerCad Circuits, the code is within the project. Credits are in the code.</p>

     <p id = "Fishtank">Here is an image of a virtual fish tank I made in Javascript. You might have to click the button more than once to start spawning fish, sorry.</p>
